		<p>We stayed at the Cosmopolitan for six nights in February 2013. The reception area was very impressive, all reception staff/ front of house were very polite and quick to serve. We had a double room with city view, overlooking the bilagio fountains. </p>

		<p>I hesitated at first to book this hotel due to the numbers of negative feedback's here. Well, I am so glad I booked this hotel!!! I flew from Singapore to Honolulu and reached the hotel exhausted. I'm surprised on how ground staffs treated their visitors so warmly.</p>
